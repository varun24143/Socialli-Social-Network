# Future Plans

As we have already established that Socialli is a social token project which is going to solve multiple problems but in different phases. After successful completion, testing and rolling out of Phase 1 (Social Networks) we will have a support team constantly working with the development team to make sure that everything is robust, while the experts in the other vertical start working for Phase 2 (Brands) which will have its own set of milestones to be achieved.

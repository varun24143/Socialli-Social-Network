# Socialli Identity

On socialli we allow for any user to create their profile which will generate their identity, that can be used across any vertical/dapp which is built on top of Socialli.&#x20;

This single identity will help us bridge the gap of users to be onboarded on any vertical and in future join any metaverse also which is built on Socialli.&#x20;

Any team building their social n/w via socialli will be as transparent as it could be to help the users also participate in the overall governance of their own network. Each n/w in itself will be a decentralised organisation where the users will have the ownership of their own content and help in shaping the direction of the network.

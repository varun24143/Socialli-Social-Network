# Tokenomics

Understanding the Tokenomics of any protocol is equally important to understanding of the protocol itself.&#x20;

Socialli involves the benefit of a community driven tokenomics. The main Socialli token gets appreciated as and when the custom social tokens get acquired and continue to grow their community. In simpler terms the value of a custom social token will be correlated to that applications popularity. Once the social token becomes popular the social token supply curve comes in picture to appreciate the overall price of the Socialli token. In short, the main Socialli token's value is appreciated by the people and for the people, which is the true nature of a decentralised ecosystem.

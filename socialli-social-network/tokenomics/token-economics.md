# Token Economics

Any team building on Socialli will have to acquire the Socialli tokens in order to utilise the sdk and build their dapp. While launching their custom dapp they can create their own social token which will generate the value based on various transactions and buying, selling etc. on their custom dapp and a special implementation of token bonding curve will generate the overall price for the Socialli token as well.

Any end user can swap their custom tokens to any other custom token as well via the Socialli token.



### Token Usage and Distribution

The native socialli token will have a number of different uses and its impact.

The main use of the Socialli token will be for teams to build their dapps and monetize their network in different ways. Using the native Socialli token they can deploy their custom social tokens and can swap to other social tokens as well within the Socialli ecosystem.&#x20;

There are definitely going to be certain teams within the socialli ecosystem who will perform and contribute relatively more then the other teams, as such these teams will be awarded with Socialli tokens. Any team can also stake their own custom social token to be rewarded with the Socialli token, this will be a form of reward to be paid from the pool of network rewards.&#x20;

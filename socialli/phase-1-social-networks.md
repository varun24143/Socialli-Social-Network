# Phase 1 - Social Networks

We all know that there are no chains that are specifically designed to solve a particular issue. While most of the chains are focusing on building various kinds of dapps on it, we want to focus on a chain which is specific to social tokens.&#x20;

For our first phase we will be invested in building the chain which focuses primarily on Social Networks.&#x20;

This solution is a dire need of the hour, in order to eliminate the monopolisation of the creator’s content. This is just the starting point where the social media content would be moving from the centralised clutches to the public pool that no centralised body controls or manages.&#x20;

Imagine a world where content creators are actually helping each other out by publishing everything on the blockchain via which they don’t let the big corporations hold the data in a private form. Instead making it available to every user and the network becomes more powerful and highly engaging for all the users. This multiplies the reach of the creators and also builds their own moat. Here the coin has actually 2 sides, one being the reach, while the other is monetisation. The term social token justifies this correctly, by letting the users build their Social brand and generate tokens in return for themselves.

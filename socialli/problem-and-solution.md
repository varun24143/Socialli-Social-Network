# Problem & Solution

## Problems

### What problems are we trying to solve ?&#x20;

#### User Experience -&#x20;

The scope of the social token industry is vast, but there is no vertical focused functionality for a specific type of social token. Thanks to view2earn, metaverses and play2earn games combined with blockchain it has become really disruptive. The user experience needs to be richer, which could be focused by the frontend team and rest of the functional logic and backend could be heavily off loaded via Socialli sdk.

#### Lack of Interoperability -&#x20;

Naturally we see that a dapp built on a platform like Ethereum is not compatible with something like Polkadot. So considering an sdk which solves the issue of interoperability from the word go by building bridges and customizing them as per every use case.

## Solution

### What does Socialli do differently ?&#x20;

#### Plug and Play Solutions -&#x20;

Building with Socialli will ensure that we take care of services and framework, on the other hand the projects can customize it as per the requirements which can fit in any vertical of the offering.&#x20;

#### Interoperability and forkless upgrades -

Socialli will provide a future-proof way of building a Dapp by making it cross-functional across various chains and also lets you have your own centralized database where the user's accountId can be mapped with any configured data. The below image gives the detailed overview of Socialli and how it can help the projects and what features can be used to plug and play around with Socialli

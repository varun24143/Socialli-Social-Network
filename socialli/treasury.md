# Treasury

The Socialli treasury is going to be global pool of tokens that can be spent on community proposals to help further the project and ecosystem. It is envisioned that the treasury could sponsor things such as ongoing development of the Socialli sdk, managing cohorts and writing playbooks, creating different dapps, marketing, and growing the community.

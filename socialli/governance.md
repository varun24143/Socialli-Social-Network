# Governance

Every dapp built on top of socialli sdk can have their own governance for governing their ecosystem. This way it makes it flexible for any team to develop and maintain their own set of governing rules.

In addition to this there will be a global governance mechanism in place for the Socialli chain as well. As we are aware of Polkadot and Kusama's governance, similarly the Socialli token holders will be able to create and vote on on-chain proposals, participate in bounties and make important feature based decisions too.

The governance of the chain will decide how the chain upgrades and how the treasury funds are spent. Possible upgrade examples include new modules that provide new functionality options for all teams building on Socialli or whether Socialli should include integrations with other social networks/games/brands/communities and chains.

## Socialli Social Network

Socialli is a layer-1 chain which is built using Substrate. It is the easiest way to build and deploy your projects on the Polkadot ecosystem. Building via Socialli ensures that all your dapps are future proof, thanks to Substrateâ€™s forkless upgrades. Even if new substrate based chains are invented, your dapp will instantly be compatible with any other chain.

If you are a developer who has just started their journey or if you are a seasoned developer, the socialli playbooks, along with the Socialli build team can help you to further customize as per your use case to add extra functionalities to your product then the base offered.

&#x20;Socialli aims to make history by bridging the DAOs and communities together. All this will be possible by the mass adoption of web 3.0 to all the mainstream use cases like Social networking, gaming, brands, creators and celebs. For this big undertaking, the Socialli team has scheduled different launch phases to focus on delivering a full featured network. Every phase in socialli will be going in parallel when it comes to Substrate development. The phases covering launch, governance, finalization, testnet etc., might differ in the timeline for each and every use case based on the councilâ€™s decision, community support and campaigning.
